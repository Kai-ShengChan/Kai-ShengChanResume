        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Kai-Sheng Chan or you can call me Moe as it's my nickname, I am a UCR freshman major in Pre-Business programe. I am expecting to get into The shcool of Business in UCR with a concentration in Supply Chain Management as my final goal. I am 20 years old this year and the reason for that is the gap year I took. Under pendemic, many student decided to toook a gap year just like what I did. I am an international student and I after I graduated from my senior school I served in a military service as it's madantory for every male in Taiwan as they are over 18 years old. I spent 4 months to partispate in military training and got out by the date of April 24th, 2021. Then I started doing part time job in varies area of field work to seek what I really interested to learn. 

        I took a leadership role in a school drama club as a backstage manager for 2 years, leading nearly 25 people to maintain the performance. As a performance required many departments to work as one, I assigned people in different positions with suitable individuals to ensure the performance went well. Moreover, taking leadership allows me to be responsible for many things, such as solving the conflicts between crew members and maintaining the quality of the performance. For instance, actors need props for particular scenes, and props groups need to satisfy demands from them, such as the dimensions of the props.<br><br>

        To my understanding, a small misunderstanding or delay could cause chaos and result in the failure of many. Blames and distrust could create a negative effect on the group and result in a stalemate; therefore, as an intermediary, I must think of a proper way to break the stalemate. For instance, I often contact crew members in person for more accurate information instead of communicating through texts in order to show that I treat the performance with the utmost seriousness. I found doing this made things more efficient and effective with fewer disputes occurring.Although it costs me precious time when I can do other things I like, I hold a belief that it is important to become a model that is willing to sacrifice his own time and contribute to the group. In addition, discovering the characteristics needed as a leader inspires me to become a model that encourages others to follow, to become an influencer that shares good team spirit, and to become a caring person that helps others. In conclusion, leadership has taught me to treat others with compassion and empathy and to recognize the benefits of teamwork. In my life, I met many people from different cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and personal characteristics. Because every individual has their own perspective, I began to learn how to seek a balance between many. Being a leader, I took an objective perspective to consider every move before making a decision, utilizing effective communication helped me do things more efficiently.
